# Reading-List
This is a simple website that stores the name of books and fetch an random image to make the list of names of books look good.

## Commands run the Project
1. "npm install" to install the essential packages.
2. "npm start" to run react project.
3. "npm run server" to run local server.

## What I have learn
1. I have learned the use of "useEffect" hook. This hook is very useful because it can run the code accourding to our need.
2. I have learned how to save, retieve, edit data in local .json file.
3. Now I can use the "useContext" and "createContext" for the context switching of the data which help in smoother data flow instead of using the props.
4. I have also learned how to make our custom hooks.
